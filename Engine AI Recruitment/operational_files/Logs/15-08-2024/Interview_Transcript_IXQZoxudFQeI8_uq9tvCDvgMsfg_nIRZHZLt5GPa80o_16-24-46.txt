system: Selamat pagi, thank you for having me. I'm excited to be here.

Analyzing user needs and developing proportional solutions is a crucial aspect of my work as a professional. In my previous role as a Business Analyst at XYZ Corporation, I was tasked with understanding the requirements of our clients and developing tailored solutions to meet their needs.

One example that comes to mind is when we had a client in the e-commerce industry who was facing issues with their order processing system. They were experiencing delays in processing orders, which resulted in dissatisfied customers and revenue losses.

To analyze their needs, I conducted stakeholder interviews, observed their current processes, and gathered data on their order volume and processing times. I identified the root cause of the issue to be inefficient manual processing and inadequate system integration.

Based on my analysis, I proposed a solution that involved automating their order processing system using workflow automation tools and integrating it with their existing ERP system. I worked closely with our development team to design and implement the solution, ensuring that it met the client's requirements and was scalable to accommodate their growing business.

The result was a significant reduction in order processing times, from an average of 2 hours to just 30 minutes. Our client saw a 25% increase in customer satisfaction and a 15% increase in revenue. This project demonstrated my ability to analyze user needs, develop proportional solutions, and collaborate with stakeholders to deliver results.

In general, my approach to analyzing user needs involves empathizing with their pain points, gathering data to understand their requirements, and applying my knowledge and expertise to develop innovative solutions that meet their needs. I believe this approach is essential in delivering value to users and driving business success.
