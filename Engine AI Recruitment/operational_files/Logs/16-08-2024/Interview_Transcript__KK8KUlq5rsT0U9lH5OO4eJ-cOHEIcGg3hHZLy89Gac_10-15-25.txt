system: Selamat pagi! Terima kasih atas kesempatan ini. Saya senang dapat berbagi pengalaman saya dengan Anda.

When it comes to handling user requests and gathering detailed user needs, I believe it's essential to have a clear and structured approach. In my previous projects, I've followed a user-centered design methodology to ensure that I understand the users' requirements accurately.

Firstly, I would start by conducting stakeholder interviews to identify the key users and their respective needs. This involves asking open-ended questions to understand their pain points, goals, and expectations from the project. I would also review any available documentation, such as requirement documents or previous research studies, to get a better understanding of the project's context.

Next, I would create user personas to represent the different types of users and their needs. This helps me to empathize with the users and prioritize the requirements accordingly. I would then develop a set of user stories and use cases to capture the functional and non-functional requirements of the project.

To gather detailed user needs, I would conduct surveys, focus groups, or user testing sessions to validate the user stories and use cases. This feedback would help me to refine the requirements and identify any gaps or areas that need further clarification.

Throughout the project, I would maintain an open communication channel with the stakeholders and users to ensure that their needs are being met and that any changes or concerns are addressed promptly. This includes providing regular project updates, demo sessions, and progress reports to keep everyone informed and aligned.

In terms of prioritization, I would use tools such as MoSCoW method or Kano model to categorize the user needs based on their must-haves, should-haves, and nice-to-haves. This helps me to focus on the most critical requirements and allocate the resources accordingly.

By following this structured approach, I've been able to effectively handle user requests and gather detailed user needs, resulting in successful project outcomes that meet the users' expectations.
